## Dataset

### Amazon Fine Food Reviews Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle - Amazon Fine Food Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews)
- **Size**: ~568MB (full dataset), ~50k samples used by default
- **Format**: CSV file with review text and metadata
- **Features**: Review text, summary, score, helpfulness, time

### Dataset Setup

1. **Download the dataset** from Kaggle
2. **Rename** the file to `Reviews.csv`
3. **Place** it in the project root directory

```
text-summarizer/
├── Reviews.csv          # ← Place dataset here
├── text_summarizer.py
└── README.md
```

### Dataset Preprocessing

The system automatically handles:
- Text cleaning and normalization
- Removal of HTML tags and special characters
- Stopword filtering
- Length-based filtering (reviews between 10-100 words)
- Memory-efficient loading (configurable sample size)

## Usage

### Training Mode

Train a new model from scratch:

```bash
python text_summarizer.py
```

**Training Process:**
1. 📁 Loads and preprocesses the dataset
2. 🔄 Creates training/validation splits
3. 🧠 Builds and compiles the Seq2Seq model
4. 🎯 Trains with attention mechanism
5. 💾 Saves model and tokenizers

### Inference Mode

After training, run interactive summarization:

```bash
python text_summarizer.py
```

**Interactive Session:**
```
Text Summarizer Ready. Enter text (or 'exit'):
>> The pasta was absolutely delicious! The sauce was rich and creamy, perfectly complementing the al dente noodles. Highly recommended for Italian food lovers.

Summary: pasta delicious sauce rich creamy noodles recommended italian food

>> exit
Goodbye!
```

### Programmatic Usage

```python
from text_summarizer import TextSummarizer

# Load pretrained model
summarizer = TextSummarizer.load_model('text_summarizer_model')

# Summarize text
text = "Your long text here..."
summary = summarizer.summarize(text)
print(f"Summary: {summary}")
```

## Model Architecture

### Sequence-to-Sequence with Attention

```
Input Text → Encoder (LSTM) → Context Vector → Decoder (LSTM) → Summary
                ↓                    ↑
           Attention Weights ← Attention Layer
```

### Technical Specifications

- **Encoder**: Bidirectional LSTM (256 units)
- **Decoder**: LSTM with attention (256 units)
- **Attention**: Bahdanau-style attention mechanism
- **Embedding**: 300-dimensional word embeddings
- **Vocabulary**: 20,000 most frequent words
- **Max Length**: Input (100 words), Output (20 words)

### Training Configuration

```python
# Model hyperparameters
BATCH_SIZE = 128
EPOCHS = 50
LEARNING_RATE = 0.001
DROPOUT = 0.3
EMBEDDING_DIM = 300
LATENT_DIM = 256
